🔁 DL4IR Query Reformulator
A PyTorch-based implementation of a query reformulation framework for deep learning-based information retrieval (DL4IR).
This repository serves as a foundational component for an academic research project focusing on enhancing retrieval quality through query rewriting using neural representation models.

📌 Purpose
This repository is adapted and extended to support a research paper currently in preparation.
The main focus is on query reformulation techniques that leverage deep contextual embeddings to improve retrieval performance in open-domain QA or document-level retrieval tasks.

Key goals include:

Implementing a modular query rewriting pipeline compatible with transformer-based encoders.

Enabling fine-grained token-level reformulation using CLS-based signal extraction.

Supporting integration with downstream retrieval and ranking modules (e.g., BM25, Dense Retriever).

🛠️ Features
Query reformulation module with attention-based transformer layers (e.g., BERT/DistilBERT).

Support for:

Encoding queries with context awareness.

Dynamic reformulation strategies (e.g., appending, rewriting, masking).

Easily integrable into retrieval pipelines (e.g., ColBERT, DPR, BM25).

Scripted training & evaluation on MS MARCO / Natural Questions / custom datasets.
